				<p>I'm Julia Smadja, I am still learning my likes and dislikes in the field I have chosen, Business and Analytics. I'm a Graduate Student at American University, studying Business Analytics. I'm also trying to develop my knowledge in web programming. I have been taking classes at General Assembly in HTML and CSS. Hoping to learn JavaScript, as well as a back-end web development language, such as, Python, R, or Ruby. I have always greatly enjoyed learning math which is why I decided to look into Analytics and coding, it is a very logical subject. When I am not studying, I enjoy exploring the city that I am currently in, whether Paris or Washington D.C., reading books, exploring my artistic capabilities in drawing and painting.</p>

				<h4>Drawings</h4>
				<p>I have always loved drawing and being artistic. My struggle has been innovation and imagination. Howeveer once I have found an inspiration I, very much, enjoy to draw.</p>
